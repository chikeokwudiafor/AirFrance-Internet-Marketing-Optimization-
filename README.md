# AirFrance-Internet-Marketing-Optimization-

This is a project done in my Behavioral Analytics Class with a team of two.


Behavioral Analytics: Air France Internet Marketing campaign effectiveness using Python to analyze the factors that affect total Cost. We analyzed different metrics that could affect the campaign effectiveness. 

These were some of our observation, a detailed report can be found in the pdf on the github project.

# Observations:
We observed that of the seven variables in the above descriptive analysis, six of them have count
of 4510 rows while one of the variables, Average Revenue per Booking had only 368 rows which
is attributed to the previous setting of 0 in variable to null.

### Engine Click Thru %: 
This is the click through rate per campaign. With the mean of 11.14% and
a max of 200%; this indicates the existence of a large range within the data and corresponding
outliers. This result can be used to evaluate the performance of each campaign.

### Trans. Conv. %:
This is the rate of conversion of customers which explains the number of people
who have seen the company’s advert and end up clicking on it. With the mean of 0.57% and a max
of 900%; this indicates the existence of a large range within the data and corresponding outliers.
This is a very important KPI for organizations.

### Net Revenue:
This is estimated from (Total Revenue – Total Cost). The maximum net revenue
obtained in this dataset is $549,524.05 while the minimum is -$8,2725.92 which means there were
cases where the cost was higher than the total revenue. Measures or strategies should be put in
place to reduce or eliminate losses from high cost in search engine marketing campaigns.

### Avg. Cost per Click: 
This is the average cost of clicks charged to companies for adverts placed
on the internet. We observed a maximum of $10, a minimum of $0 and a mean of $1.89. Though
the cost-per-click of search engine keywords have seen a continuous growth in recent time
especially with the growth of new players in the market, nevertheless, there should be a strong
focus on using analytics expertise in controlling cost.

### ROA: 
This is the profit made on advertising campaigns which measures the effectiveness of the
campaign. We observed that the maximum ROA is $379,487.2, minimum of -$100 and mean $341.
This shows that there were case where no profit was recorded on a lot of campaigns, but high profit
was made from a few campaigns. Resources should be made available to continuously optimize
performance and ROA.

### Average Revenue per Booking:
We observed that a huge number of the Total Revenue and Total
Volume of Bookings were 0 values in the dataset thereby having only a record of 368 counts.
Nonetheless, the mean value is $1,024.26, a maximum of $5,877.75 and minimum of $34 which
shows there were a few cases where high revenue was made from the campaign. There should be
focus on ensure high revenue per campaign.

### Probability of Booking:
This is the probability of a customer/user seeing the advert online and
proceed to making a booking or purchase. The maximum probability of 0.81, minimum of 0.00
and a mean of 0.000681 is not an encouraging result. Strategies need to be drawn up to increase
the booking rate such as creating appealing adverts with corresponding impression which will lead
high conversion rate.
